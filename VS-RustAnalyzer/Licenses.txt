Trademark
Note that use of the Rust logos, and the Rust and Cargo names, is also governed by trademark. Our trademark policy is described in full on the Rust website, but the summary is as follows:

TL;DR: Most non-commercial uses of the Rust/Cargo names and logos are allowed and do not require permission; most commercial uses require permission. In either case, the most important rule is that uses of the trademarks cannot appear official or imply any endorsement by the Rust project.
